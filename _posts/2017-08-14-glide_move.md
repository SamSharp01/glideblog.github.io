[GlideServers](https://www.glideservers.com) has been running for a few years now.

We used to use FTP to edit the website, and while FTP is good, it has some limitations:
* No version control
* Only one person can work at a time
* SLOW
* Buggy
* Server config would change

And because of these reasons, we lacked the enthusiasm to change it often.

I moved the website to GitHub 6/08/2017, and since then, over 100 commits have been pushed and nearly 40k lines of code changed.
This is obviously a huge improvement, as it is now so much easier to change and update often.
