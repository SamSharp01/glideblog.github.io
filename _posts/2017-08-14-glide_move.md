A friend and I have been running [GlideServers](https://www.glideservers.com) for a few years now. It is a VPS hosting business that uses OpenVZ.

We used to use FTP to edit the website, and while FTP is good, it has some limitations:
* No version control
* One person can work at a time
* SLOW
* Buggy
* Server config would change

And because of these reasons, we lacked the enthusiasm to change it often.

I moved the website to GitHub 6/08/2017, and since then, I have pushed over 100 commits and changed nearly 40k lines of code.
This is obviously a huge improvement, as it is now so much easier to change and update often.

p.s - My friend is still on holiday, this is his surprise when he gets back :grinning:
