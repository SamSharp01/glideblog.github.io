CA2 (SSD Node), was nearly under full usage, so we decided it was time to move.
The new server has double the ram, and twice the CPU cores.

## Process

### August 10
* **11:44 am** Migration started to the new node. Each VPS was down for this time, but restored as the migration finished.
* **4:47 pm** Migration completed, but IP's needed to be transfered manually.

### August 11
* All VPS's were online but the IP was different.
* No IP's transfered due to inaccessability to the internet by staff.

### August 12
* ** 1:43 pm*** IP migration started, this took a while as each IP required 4 steps to move, and this was done manually.
* **4:20 pm*** IP migration finished.
