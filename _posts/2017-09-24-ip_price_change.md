# Why
We decided to increase IP pricing slightly as the way we are billed for additional IP's has changed from our provider.

# How much
Each extra IP is now $1 more expensive, and costs $1 per IP/month.

# Who
This will only affect new customers, unless we deem necessary to charge for existing plans too.

Thank you!
