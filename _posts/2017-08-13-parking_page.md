So I needed a good parking page for a few domains that I own, but don't use yet.
Here's how I made one:

1. Download a nice template from [html5up.net](http://html5up.net)
2. Butcher the hell out of the code to make it look somewhat useable.

	Well, not completely butcher, just until it works.
	I wanted something that looked nice, but was only one, non-scrollable page and was quite small
3. Reduce the code from 435 lines to 32 :)

Now it looks like this

It also has two links
* In the title - This links to the [github repo](https://github.com/GlideServers/Parking)
* In the button (more can be added) - that links to a [small business of mine](https://www.glideservers.com) / the place hosting the website.

And there you have it, a working, ready to use parking page.
